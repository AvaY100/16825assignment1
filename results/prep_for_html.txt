Also, list how many vertices and (triangle) faces your mesh should have.

2.2 Constructing a Cube

Also, list how many vertices and (triangle) faces your mesh should have.

3. Re-texturing a mesh

Point out "color1 = [1, 0, 0] and color2 = [0, 0, 1]"

4. Camera Transformations
In your report, describe in words what R_relative and T_relative should be doing and include the rendering produced by your choice of R_relative and T_relative.
Use the following information to answer:
# # 1
# R = R_relative @ torch.tensor([[0, 1.0, 0], [-1.0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]])
# 2
# T_relative=torch.tensor([0, 0, 2])
# 3
# T_relative=torch.tensor([0.5, -0.5, 0])
# 4
# R = R_relative @ torch.tensor([[0, 0, -1.0], [0, 1, 0], [-1, 0, 0]])

5.1 Rendering Point Clouds from RGB-D Images
Construct 3 different point clouds:

The point cloud corresponding to the first image
The point cloud corresponding to the second image
The point cloud formed by the union of the first 2 point clouds.
Try visualizing each of the point clouds from various camera viewpoints. We suggest starting with cameras initialized 6 units from the origin with equally spaced azimuth values.

Submission: In your submission, include a gif of each of these point clouds mentioned above side-by-side.

5.2 Parametric Functions
In your writeup, include a 360-degree gif of your torus point cloud, and make sure the hole is visible. You may choose to texture your point cloud however you wish. (10 points)
Include a 360-degree gif on any new object of your choice. (5 points)

5.3 Implicit Surfaces
In your writeup, include a 360-degree gif of your torus mesh, and make sure the hole is visible. (10 points)
In addition, discuss some of the tradeoffs between rendering as a mesh vs a point cloud. Things to consider might include rendering speed, rendering quality, ease of use, memory usage, etc. (5 points)
Include a 360-degree gif on any new object of your choice. This object can be different from what you used in 5.2 (5 points)
